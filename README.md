**Interactive Corporea** is an add-on mod for [Botania](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/botania "Botania").    
The goal of the mod is to make the corporea system in Botania easier to use and more "magical" while be faithful to [Botania's design philosophy](https://botaniamod.net/ "") (Mainly no "Full-screen" GUIs).

##Known Issues
- In a server, the interface is only visible to you. Syncing the animations is impractical, but I might find some alternative ways of displaying it in the future.
##Future Plans
- A wormhole system that allows teleporting items thrown towards the halo interface to your base (wormhole render is shader-based, and has a warp effect around it)
- Auto crafting system
##Modpack Policy
Of course! You can use this mod in your modpack.
