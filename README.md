**Interactive Corporea** is an add-on mod for [Botania](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/botania "Botania").    
The goal of the mod is to make the corporea system in Botania easier to use and more "magical" while be faithful to [Botania's design philosophy](https://botaniamod.net/ "") (Mainly no "Full-screen" GUIs).
###This mod has some fancy animations, so watch this **[spotlight video](https://streamable.com/0jrgbv "spotlight")** that demonstrates the main features of the mod.

##Future Plans

- Auto crafting system
